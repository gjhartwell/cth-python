A good database browser for access the v3fit_reconstruction_database.db 
can be found at https://sqlitebrowser.org/

Only use the DB Browser for looking at information. 
Please do not save anything from DB Browser.

If you wish to access the database programmatically, the SQLite is a
straight forward database language to learn.

Good tutorials are found at:  http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/
